<h2>Step 3 Name your machine:</h2>
You can name the virtual machine 'Windows Server 2016,' and the system should automatically set the version to Windows 2016 64-bit. If it doesn’t update automatically, ensure the correct version is manually selected and highlighted for accuracy.

<h2>Step 4 Create a Virtual Hard-disk:</h2>
It’s recommended to allocate at least 2GB of base memory for optimal performance. If your system has additional resources, you can increase the memory allocation to enhance functionality and ensure smoother operation.
